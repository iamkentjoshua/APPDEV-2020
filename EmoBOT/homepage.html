                <h1>What is EmoBot?</h1>
                <p>EmoBot is a tool designed for the CUTIE Interviewer Bot.</p><br>
                <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                <p>It has 2 main features, facial recognition and text recognition.</p>
                <p>The EmoBot uses facial recognition to detect the user's facial expressions, mood,<br>
                and attentiveness during the course of the interview simulation.<br>
                With this, the CUTIE interviewer bot can appropriately respond to what the interviewee<br>
                is currently feeling and or experiencing such as being too anxious or too giddy.<br>
                This will also alert the bot if the user is paying attention or taking<br>
                the interviews seriously as they would have during real job interviews.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the EmoBot uses text recognition to guess or analyze the user's emotions<br>
                and mood based on the way the interviewee replies to the bot.<br>
                For example, the bot would assume that the interviewee is happy to conduct the interview<br>
                if the user starts the conversation with a Good Morning or a Good Afternoon greeting.<br>
                The bot will also reply with a suggestion or a pat-in-the back message<br>
                if the user asks for a tip or if the user feels down or discouraged.</p><br>
                <h1>Who would benefit from this?</h1>
                <p>This application will greatly benefit most especially the graduating college students of<br>
                Cebu Institute of Technology University because they can now be sure that<br>
                they would ace their future job interviews with ease and confidence.<br>
                With the help of this application in partnership with the CUTIE interviewer bot,<br>
                the number of hired Cebu Institute of Technology University fresh graduates will surely increase.</p>
