    <h1>What is EmoBot?</h1>
    <p>EmoBot is a tool designed for the CUTIE Interviewer Bot.</p><br>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>It has 2 main features, facial recognition and text recognition.</p>
    <p>The EmoBot uses facial recognition to detect the user's facial expressions, mood, and attentiveness during the course of the interview simulation. With this, the CUTIE interviewer bot can
      appropriately respond to what the interviewee is currently feeling and or experiencing such as being too
      anxious or too giddy. This will also alert the bot if the user is paying attention or taking the interviews
      seriously as they would have during real job interviews.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the EmoBot uses text recognition to guess or analyze the user's emotions and mood based on the way the
      interviewee replies to the bot. For example, the bot would assume that the interviewee is happy to conduct
      the interview if the user starts the conversation with a Good Morning or a Good Afternoon greeting. The
      bot will also reply with a suggestion or a pat-in-the back message if the user asks for a tip or if the user
      feels down or discouraged.</p><br>
    <h1>Who would benefit from this?</h1>
    <p>This application will greatly benefit most especially the graduating college students of Cebu
      Institute of Technology University because they can now be sure that they would ace their future job
      interviews with ease and confidence. With the help of this application in partnership with the CUTIE
      interviewer bot, the number of hired Cebu Institute of Technology University fresh graduates will surely
      increase.</p>
